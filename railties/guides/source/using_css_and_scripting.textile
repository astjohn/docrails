As outlined above, the asset pipline bundles multiple javascript and stylesheet assets into a single asset for each, which reduces the number of requests needed to load a page.  This process is great, but what happens when we need specific javascript or styles for only one section of an application.  For example, suppose we have an application using a third party map only on one view.  We might not want to bundle some assets to carry around throughout the entire website.

h4. Requiring Specific Stylesheets

If you like to organize your stylesheets according to different views, your layout and view might contain something like the following:

+app/layouts/application.html.erb+
<ruby>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Map App</title>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag    "application" %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= yield(:stylesheets) %> # this is added to include additional stylesheets from views
  </head>
  <body>
  <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
</ruby>

+app/views/map/index.html.erb+
<ruby>
<%= content_for :stylesheets do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag :map_styles %>
<% end %>
<h1>Map</h1>
<div id="map"></div>
</ruby>

In order to ensure that these map styles are only included on the view above, we need to remove the +*= require_tree .+ line from +application.css+.  If this line is not removed, our specific stylesheet will be included in application.css and used throughout the entire application.

+app/assets/stylesheet/application.css+
<ruby>
/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
 * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
 * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 *= require_self
 *= require_tree .       <----- REMOVE THIS LINE
*/
</ruby>

Unfortunately, since we have removed this line we have to specify all our other stylesheets manually.

The last step is to create and use the +map_styles.css+ file which we specified above in our view.

+app/assets/stylesheets/map_styles.css+
<ruby>
/*
 *= require_self
 *= require maps/map_style.css.scss   <--- reference other scss files or use directly below
*/
div#map{
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}
</ruby>

h4. Requiring Specific CoffeeScript / Javascript

Requiring specific javascript files is similar to the process used for stylesheets.  You might be including your extra javascripts at the end of your document body like the following:

+app/layouts/application.html.erb+
<ruby>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Map App</title>
    <%= stylesheet_link_tag    "application" %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
    <%= yield(:stylesheets) %>
  </head>
  <body>
  <%= yield %>
  <%= yield(:javascripts) %> # this is added to include additional javascript from views
  </body>
</html>
</ruby>

+app/views/map/index.html.erb+
<ruby>
<%= content_for :stylesheets do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag :map_styles %>
<% end %>
<%= content_for :javascripts do %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag :maps %>
<% end %>
<h1>Map</h1>
<div id="map"></div>
</ruby>

As with stylesheets, in order to ensure that this javascript is only included on the view above, we need to remove the +*= require_tree .+ line from +application.js+.  If this line is not removed, our specific javascript will be included in application.js and used throughout the entire application.

+app/assets/javascripts/application.js+
<ruby>
// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into including all the files listed below.
// Add new JavaScript/Coffee code in separate files in this directory and they'll automatically
// be included in the compiled file accessible from http://example.com/assets/application.js
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// the compiled file.
//
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require_tree .       <----- REMOVE THIS LINE
</ruby>

The last step is to create and use the +maps.js+ file which might require several other coffeescript files:

+app/assets/javascripts/maps.js+
<ruby>
//= require maps/map_load.js.coffee
</ruby>

+app/assets/javascripts/maps/map_load.js.coffee+
<ruby>
# some map loading code...
alert "Map Loaded"
</ruby>
